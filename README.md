During lunchbreak, most students and staff members rush to grab a bite from the food trucks. This results in them queuing for the most part of the lunchbreak,
and they end up not getting enough time to enjoy their food/ lunch, while some end up not ordering at all and having to attend lectures hungry.
thers compromise attending lectures to place orders.
The long queues tend to also overwhelm the vendors as they have to multi-task by taking orders, prepare the food, and heaving to deal with undecided customers.
The system â€˜s objective is to enable students and/or staff to place food orders in advance to minimise queuing time. 
This will aid in them not missing/ compromising lectures for lunch and missing lunch. 
The system allows vendors to decrease the food preparation time and manage orders efficiently without dealing with many undecided customers.
The vendor will be able to register their business on the system.
The systems will allow the vendor to add foodItem(s) for specific days and indicate the availability of food items on the foodItem. 
When the order is ready for collection, the system will allow the vendor to notify the customer. 
Vendors will have the flexibility to choose their preferred payment method at any time during their operations. 
This will allow them to easily switch to a different payment method if, for example, their card machine fails, and they can indicate that they only accept cash for a specific day.
The customer will be able to register their details on the system, log-in to see the available foodItem (s) for various vendors, and place order(s).
Upon ordering, the customer will select the preferred available payment method.
